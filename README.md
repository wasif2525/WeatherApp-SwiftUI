## Discussions

I have used `SwiftUI` for user interface creation, `Combine framework` allows me to use features like Observable, states, publishers and subscribers. `MVVM` design pattern helped me to use features like less code, more decoupling, modular approach, easy to test, Bindings make UI updates easier to handle, ease of maintainability etc.
